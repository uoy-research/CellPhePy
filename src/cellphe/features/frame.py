     Calculates cell features from timelapse videos

     Calculates 74 features related to size, shape, texture and movement for each cell on every non-missing frame,
     as well as the cell density around each cell on each frame.
     NB: while the ROI filenames are expected to be provided in ``df`` and found
     in ``roi_folder``,
     the frame filenames are just expected to follow the naming convention
     ``<some text>-<FrameID>.tiff``,
     where FrameID is a 4 digit leading zero-padded number, corresponding to the
     ``FrameID`` column in ``df``.

     :param df: DataFrame where every row corresponds to a combination of a cell
     tracked in a frame. It must have at least columns ``CellID``, ``FrameID`` and
     ``ROI_filename`` along with any additional features.
     :param roi_folder: A path to a directory containing multiple Report Object Instance
     (ROI) files named in the format ``cellid``-``frameid``.roi
     :param frame_folder: A path to a directory containing multiple frames in TIFF format.
     It is assumed these are named under the pattern ``<experiment
     name>-<frameid>.tif``, where
     ``<frameid>`` is a 4 digit zero-padded integer.
     :param framerate: The frame-rate, used to provide a meaningful measurement unit for velocity,
        otherwise a scaleless unit is implied with ``framerate=1``.
    :return: A dataframe with 77+N columns (where N is the number of imported features)
     and 1 row per cell per frame it's present in:
       * ``FrameID``: the numeric frameID
       * ``CellID``: the numeric cellID
       * ``ROI_filename``: the ROI filename
       * ``...``: 74 frame specific features
       * ``...``: Any other data columns that were present in ``df``
